Weather Forecast website, made in React. 
Uses the API of openweathermap.org

Plans for improvement:
- Adding responsive design ✔️
- Suggests in searchbar
- Showing weather data on load, based on users location

(I intentionally left a free API key in the built version, so anyone can try out the app.)
