Weather Forecast website, made in React. <br/>
Uses the API of https://openweathermap.org <br/>
Creator of the weather icons I used: https://www.iconfinder.com/Neolau1119 <br/>

Plans for improvement:

- Adding responsive design ✅
- Suggestions in searchbar
- Showing weather data on load, based on users location ✅

(I intentionally left a free API key in the built version, so anyone can try out the app.)
